Walnut and Tolex 6U x 126hp case
================================


Description
-----------
This case is made of 3/4" think walnut side panels and 1/2" plywood covered in Tolex. The lid is attached via butterfly surface latches.

It can be stacked on the tilted stand for a 12U x 126hp studio setup.

Construction
-
Front/Back/Bottom plywood panels can be screwed & glued together. Counter-sink screws and then use wood putty to cover them before applying Tolex. Walnut side panels can be attached via glue and l-brackets or maybe even biscuits.

Materials
-

Walnut Side Panels:  3/4" thick x 153.8mm wide (~6.1") x 299.2mm (~11.8") long 

 - To build two cases, need ~5" of 1x8 S4S walnut  (maybe get 6-8' in case you make mistakes)

Plywood front/back: 1/2" thick x 153.8mm wide (~6.1") x 646.1mm wide (~25.5")

 - Need 4 pieces

Plywood top/bottom: 1/2" thick x 260.5mm wide (~10.3) x 646.1mm wide (~25.5")

 - Need 4 pieces

Future Considerations
---------------------
 - The bottom of the case should probably have rubber feet attached so
   it can be laid flat on a table. 
 - Case power should be exposed through
   a hole in the left, right, or back panel. If the case is to be used
   flat on a table, suggest exposing power out the left side panel.
